Maintaining privacy while managing an alternative online identity can be challenging, but with some thoughtful steps, you can significantly improve your security. This guide isn't comprehensive, but it's a great starting point. Keep learning and check out the resources linked at the end!

## Privacy Foundations

1. **NEVER share personal details. Period.**  
   Keep real names, locations, age, work history, and other identifying information to yourself. Even casual mentions of your life can reveal more than you think, especially when shared over time.

2. **Take time to establish your alias.**  
   Changing usernames or erasing details later can be tough. Start by choosing a name, creating a backstory, and setting up a digital hub for your accounts. Keep everything separate from your real life‚Äîuse different accounts (and apps) for everything. Don't let the wires cross.

3. **Use nicknames when referencing real-life people.**  
   Avoid mentioning people you know in real life, but if you must, use nicknames or fake names instead. Never share any part of their real names.

## Establishing an Alias & Backstory

1. **Create a distinct alias.**  
   Develop a unique name, username, and fictional backstory. It can resemble your real life but should not be true in any way. Add fake elements to throw off anyone trying to dig too deep (this is sometimes called "counter-doxxing"). Take the time to write this out, including a name, location, and short bio. Consistency is key.  
   *Bonus:* Use a service like [InstantUsername.com](https://instantusername.com/) to check if your username is available on the platforms you plan to use.

2. **Use an alternative date of birth (DOB).**  
   Choose a birth date that‚Äôs close but not identical to your real one. Try a simple pattern, like subtracting or adding 3 to the day, 2 to the month, and 1 to the year. This helps keep your real details private.

## Setting Up and Maintaining Your Privacy

1. **Create a privacy-focused email.**  
   Sign up for an encrypted email service like [ProtonMail](https://mail.proton.me/). This will be the central hub for all your alt accounts.

2. **Use a unique alias across all accounts.**  
   When setting up social media or other online accounts, use your privacy-focused email, be consistent with your username, verify your email, and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for each account.

3. **Use a dedicated browser for privacy.**  
   Choose a privacy-focused browser like [Brave](https://brave.com/) for all your alternative activities. Keep it separate from your everyday browsing.

4. **Reduce your real-life data online.**  
   Services like [EasyOptOuts](https://easyoptouts.com) or [Optery](https://optery.com) can help remove personal information from data broker sites.

## Monitoring Your Online Footprint

1. **Set up [Google Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts).**  
   Create alerts for your real name, pseudonym, and any usernames you've used. This will help notify you if your information is posted publicly.

2. **Monitor data breaches.**  
   Register both your personal and alias emails with [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/). You'll get alerts if your email addresses appear in a data breach, allowing you to act quickly.

## Strengthening Your Security

It‚Äôs crucial to use long, unique passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all accounts.

1. **Use strong, unique passwords.**  
   Always choose long, unique passwords for each account. A password manager like [LastPass](https://lastpass.com) or [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com) is essential. Use it to generate 19+ character passwords for each account. The only password you need to remember is the one for your password manager.  
   *Bonus:* Use secure notes in your password manager to store details about your alias.

2. **Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).**  
   Activate MFA on any platform that offers it (e.g., Reddit, ProtonMail). Use an authenticator app like [2FAS](https://2fas.com) for added protection against phishing or account compromise. [2FAS has a helpful guide](https://2fas.com/how-to-enable-2fa/) for setting up MFA on different services.
